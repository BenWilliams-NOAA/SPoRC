\arguments{
\item{recruitment_model}{Integer flag specifying the recruitment model:

  \item `0` = mean recruitment
  \item `1` = Beverton–Holt recruitment with steepness
}}

\itemize{
  \item `0` = local (region-specific)
  \item `1` = global (shared across regions)
}}

\item{y}{Current model year (used for SSB lag indexing)}

\item{rec_lag}{Recruitment lag (number of years between spawning and recruitment)}

\item{R0}{Virgin or mean recruitment (global scalar)}

\item{Rec_Prop}{Vector of recruitment proportions by region (used to allocate global `R0` under local density dependence)}

\item{h}{Vector of Beverton–Holt steepness values by region}

\item{natmort}{Matrix or vector of natural mortality by region and age}

\item{SSB_vals}{Matrix of spawning stock biomass (SSB) by region and year}

\item{Movement}{3D array of movement probabilities between regions by age (`[origin, destination, age]` or alternatively, `[n_regions, n_regions, age]`)}

\item{do_recruits_move}{Logical or integer flag (0/1) indicating whether recruits move during their first year}

\item{t_spawn}{Fraction of the year at which spawning occurs (used for survival to spawning)}

\item{sex_ratio_f}{Vector of female proportions by region (used to scale initial recruits)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length `n_regions` containing deterministic
recruitment values for each region.
}
\description{
Computes deterministic recruitment for each region based on either
a mean recruitment model or a Beverton–Holt stock–recruitment relationship.
}
\details{
The function returns region-specific deterministic recruitment estimates
based on the chosen recruitment model and density dependence structure.

When `recruitment_model = 0`, recruitment is fixed at mean values (`R0 * Rec_Prop`).
When `recruitment_model = 1`, Beverton–Holt recruitment is applied using:
\deqn{R = \frac{4hR_0SSB}{(1 - h)S_0 + (5h - 1)SSB}}
where `S_0` is unfished spawning biomass per recruit, computed separately for each
region (local) or summed across all regions (global).
