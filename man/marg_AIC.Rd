\title{Calculate the Corrected marginal AIC (AICc) from Optimization Results}
\usage{
marg_AIC(opt, p = 2, n = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt}{A list containing optimization results. Must include either:
\itemize{
  \item `"par"` and `"objective"` (e.g., from `optim`), or
  \item `"par"` and `"value"` (e.g., from `nlminb`)
}}

\item{p}{Numeric. Penalty multiplier for the number of parameters. Default is 2.}

\item{n}{Numeric. Sample size. Default is `Inf`.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The corrected AIC (AICc) value.
}
\description{
Computes the corrected marginal Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)
for model selection using optimization results. It supports objects returned
from different optimizers, such as `optim` or `nlminb`.
